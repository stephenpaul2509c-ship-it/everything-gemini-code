# Plan Canvas Command

Opens a local artifact in the Plan Canvas — EGC's browser review surface —
where the user annotates elements, chats with you, and approves the plan or
requests changes without leaving the page.

This command is a thin entry point over the `plan-canvas` skill. Follow that
skill for the full workflow and rules.

## What This Command Does

1. Resolve the artifact: the given path, else the most recently modified
   `.gemini/plans/*.plan.md`, else ask what to review.
2. `node scripts/plan-canvas.js open <artifact>` (or `egc-plan-canvas open <artifact>`) — opens the user's browser.
3. `node scripts/plan-canvas.js await <artifact>` (or `egc-plan-canvas await <artifact>`) — block until feedback,
   verdict, or session end; leave it running.
4. Apply feedback to the artifact file (the canvas live-reloads), answer with
   `await <artifact> --reply "..."`, and repeat until the user approves or
   ends the session.

An `approve` verdict counts as plan confirmation for `/plan`-style gates:
stop polling, `end` the session, and begin implementation.

## Example

```
User: /plan-canvas .gemini/plans/notifications.plan.md

Assistant: (runs open + await, browser opens)
...user clicks "Request changes" with two annotations...
Assistant: (edits the plan, replies in-canvas, awaits again)
...user clicks "Approve plan"...
Assistant: Plan approved in the canvas — starting implementation.
```
